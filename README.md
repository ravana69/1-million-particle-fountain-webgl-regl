# 1 Million Particle Fountain (WebGL/regl)

I'm learning WebGL and I wanted to explore its limits by rendering a large number of particles.

On mobile it defaults to 300,000 particles, on desktop it defaults to 1,000,000.

If you're on a powerful system you can push it further by adding a `?p=` query param with the number of particles to generate, e.g. two million:
